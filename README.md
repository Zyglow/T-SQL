# T-SQL
Repo for T-SQL queries

This repo is a collection of T-SQL scripts I wrote while supporting SQL Server 2008 through 2016.  Most are simply quality of life functions, while others such as my availability group SQL agent job rollover script sovled a significant problem with SQL 214.  

While I cannot guarentee these will work on modern SQL Server you are welcome to give it a go.
